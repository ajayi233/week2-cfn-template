# CloudFormation Template for Secure VPC Deployment

This CloudFormation template is designed to deploy a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both public and private subnets, EC2 instances, and an Apache web server. The deployment includes security considerations to ensure secure access and management.

## Overview

- **VPC**: A Virtual Private Cloud with a CIDR block of `10.0.0.0/16`.
- **Subnets**:
  - Public subnets: `10.0.1.0/24` and `10.0.2.0/24`
  - Private subnets: `10.0.3.0/24` and `10.0.4.0/24`
- **Instances**:
  - Public EC2 instance running an Apache web server
  - Private EC2 instance for internal use
- **Security**:
  - Security Groups to allow necessary inbound/outbound traffic
  - IAM roles and Instance Profiles for secure instance management
  - A NAT Gateway for secure internet access to private instances

## Resources

- **VPC**: Enables DNS support and hostnames, tagged as `MyVPC`.
- **Subnets**:
  - Public subnets allow public IPs on launch and are associated with a public route table.
  - Private subnets do not allow public IPs and are associated with a private route table.
- **Internet Gateway**: Attached to the VPC for internet access.
- **Route Tables**:
  - Public Route Table with a route to the Internet Gateway.
  - Private Route Table with a route to the NAT Gateway.
- **NAT Gateway**: Provides internet access to private instances, using an Elastic IP.
- **Security Groups**:
  - Web Server SG: Allows HTTP and SSH from anywhere.
  - Private Instance SG: Allows SSH from within the VPC only.

## Security Considerations

- **Security Groups**: Ensure least privilege by restricting inbound and outbound traffic.
- **IAM Roles**: Use roles to manage permissions for EC2 instances securely.
- **User Data Scripts**: Used for instance initialization and configuration.

## Usage

1. Update the `Parameters` section with your specific configurations, such as the AMI ID and Key Pair.
2. Deploy the template using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.
3. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create the resources specified in this template.
